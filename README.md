AegisOS - Secure & Private Smartphone OS Development Plan

**Project Vision:** Build a *truly* secure & private smartphone OS (AegisOS) prioritizing **user sovereignty**, **hardware-enforced security**, and **zero non-consensual data collection**. Targets high-end Android-compatible hardware initially, with long-term iOS parity goals. *Not a fork*â€”a ground-up rebuild with strict security-by-design principles.

**Core Philosophy:**  
`Security = Minimized Attack Surface + Hardware Trust Anchors + Transparency`  
`Privacy = Data Minimization + User Consent + No Hidden Telemetry`

---

### Phase 0: Foundation & Constraints (Weeks 1-4)
*   **Critical:** Define non-negotiables *before* coding starts.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Formal Security Model:** Draft threat model (NSA-level threats, corporate data harvesting, physical theft). Define required security properties (e.g., "All user data encrypted at rest *and* in transit, even from OS kernel").
    2.  **Hardware Requirements:** Mandate hardware support (e.g., ARM TrustZone, dedicated Secure Element, verified boot ROM). *No software-only security compromises.*
    3.  **Privacy Charter:** Explicitly ban:
        *   Non-essential telemetry (0% default collection)
        *   Behavioral profiling
        *   Hidden background data access
        *   Forced cloud sync
        *   *Exception:* User-enabled *opt-in* crash diagnostics (fully auditable).
    4.  **Open Core Mandate:** 100% of OS code **must** be open-source (GPLv3+). *No binary blobs in critical path.* Vendor HALs must be auditable.
    5.  **Target Device Selection:** Partner with 1-2 manufacturers (e.g., Fairphone, /e/OS compatible devices) for initial hardware validation. *No custom hardware dev at this stage.*

### Phase 1: Secure Core Build (Weeks 5-20)
*   **Goal:** Bare-metal secure foundation. *No network stack, no UI yet.*
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Bootloader & Verified Boot:**
        *   Implement custom bootloader (replacing AOSP bootloader) with strict chain of trust.
        *   All stages (Boot ROM â†’ Bootloader â†’ Kernel) cryptographically verified (RSA-4096/PQC hybrid).
        *   *User-controlled key enrollment* (user flashes initial keys via USB-C).
    2.  **Kernel Hardening:**
        *   Start with latest LTS Linux kernel (min. 6.6+).
        *   **Mandatory Patches:**
            *   Full userspace isolation (e.g., Landlock, Seccomp-BPF everywhere)
            *   Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) + Stack Protector (strong)
            *   Disable all non-essential drivers/modules (e.g., Wi-Fi direct, NFC by default)
            *   Apply grsecurity/PaX-inspired patches (where compatible)
            *   *Zero tolerance for "convenience" security bypasses.*
    3.  **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Audit:**
        *   Rebuild all HALs (camera, sensors, modem) from source.
        *   Strip all non-essential functionality (e.g., camera HAL only exposes raw image data, *no* on-device AI processing).
        *   Implement strict access control lists (ACLs) for hardware resources.
    4.  **Secure Storage:**
        *   Mandatory FBE (File-Based Encryption) with per-file keys.
        *   Keys *never* leave Secure Element/Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
        *   Implement *plausible deniability* via hidden volumes (user-activated).

### Phase 2: Privacy-First User Space (Weeks 21-40)
*   **Goal:** Minimalist, user-controlled environment. *Privacy is the default setting.*
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Microkernel-Like Services:**
        *   Replace monolithic system services with isolated, capability-based microservices (e.g., using seL4-inspired principles where feasible).
        *   Each service (telephony, location, contacts) runs in its own sandbox with *least privilege*.
    2.  **Privacy Control Center:**
        *   System-wide dashboard showing *all* app permissions *and* hardware access (mic, cam, location).
        *   **Per-App Permissions:**
            *   "Allow once" / "Deny always" / "Fake data" (e.g., random location)
            *   Real-time access indicators (physical LED for mic/cam)
            *   *No "always allow" for sensitive permissions.*
    3.  **Network Stack Hardening:**
        *   Mandatory DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS by default (user-configurable resolver).
        *   Built-in firewall (per-app network control).
        *   *No* background network access without explicit user grant.
        *   Disable non-essential radios (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) by default on boot.
    4.  **Zero Telemetry Framework:**
        *   Build system where *no data leaves device* unless user explicitly triggers an action (e.g., sending an email).
        *   Audit all code for hidden logging/call homes (static + dynamic analysis).
        *   Replace Google Play Services equivalent with *user-owned* open-source alternatives (e.g., MicroG *only if* fully audited & stripped to bare minimum).

### Phase 3: Application Ecosystem & Usability (Weeks 41-60)
*   **Goal:** Secure, private apps without sacrificing core functionality.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **App Sandboxing 2.0:**
        *   Extend Android sandbox: Apps *cannot* access other app data *or* global OS state without explicit inter-process consent.
        *   Implement *data diodes* for inter-app communication (strictly controlled pipes).
    2.  **Curated App Store (AegisStore):**
        *   **Mandatory:** All apps must be open-source (or provide verifiable build scripts).
        *   **Strict Vetting:** Automated + manual audit for privacy violations, hidden trackers, excessive permissions.
        *   **Transparency Labels:** Detailed breakdown of *all* data accessed/collected by the app.
    3.  **Privacy-Enhanced Core Apps:**
        *   Build minimal core apps (SMS, Dialer, Email, Browser) with:
            *   No telemetry
            *   Built-in tracker blocking (browser)
            *   End-to-end encryption by default (SMS â†’ Signal-compatible protocol)
            *   *No* cloud backups unless user sets up their own server.
    4.  **User Experience (UX) for Security:**
        *   Security prompts designed for *informed consent* (not "click-through" fatigue).
        *   Visual indicators for encryption status, network security, permission usage.
        *   *No* "security by obscurity" â€“ educate users via concise tooltips.

### Phase 4: Verification, Deployment & Maintenance (Ongoing)
*   **Goal:** Sustain trust through transparency and rapid response.
*   **Tasks:**
    1.  **Continuous Auditing:**
        *   Fund independent third-party security audits (e.g., Trail of Bits, Quarkslab) *every 6 months*.
        *   Public bug bounty program (min. $10k critical bug).
        *   All audit reports public by default.
    2.  **Update Mechanism:**
        *   Signed, delta updates delivered over Tor/Onion services *by default*.
        *   *User must verify update signature* before installation (via separate device/app).
        *   Rollback protection (verified boot blocks downgrades).
    3.  **Hardware Security Integration:**
        *   Deep integration with TEE for key management (e.g., Android Keystore replacement).
        *   Secure Element used for biometric data (templates *never* leave SE).
        *   *Document all hardware dependencies and trust boundaries.*
    4.  **Transparency Dashboard:**
        *   Public dashboard showing:
            *   Code commits (with diffs)
            *   Audit status
            *   Update verification logs
            *   Bug bounty stats
    5.  **Community Governance:**
        *   Public roadmap & RFC process for major changes.
        *   Foundation model (non-profit) to prevent corporate capture.

### Critical Dependencies & Risks
| **Dependency**          | **Risk Mitigation**                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardware Support**    | Partner *early* with OEMs; prioritize devices with open firmware (e.g., Librem 5). Avoid custom silicon until Phase 3. |
| **App Ecosystem**       | Start with F-Droid core; incentivize devs via grants. *Never compromise security for app compatibility.* |
| **Funding**             | Non-profit model + user donations + ethical enterprise support (e.g., privacy-focused businesses). *No VC funding.* |
| **Usability**           | Invest heavily in UX research. Security fails if users disable it. |
| **Supply Chain Attacks**| Full reproducible builds; mandatory code signing by multiple trusted parties. |

### Why This Isn't Just Another "Secure Android Fork"
- **No Compromises on Telemetry:** Unlike GrapheneOS (which retains some Google services), AegisOS starts from *zero* data collection.
- **Hardware Trust First:** Leverages Secure Element/TEE for *enforcement*, not just encryption.
- **User as Root Authority:** User holds ultimate keys (verified boot, update signing).
- **Openness as Security:** 100% auditable code â€“ no "trusted" binaries.
- **Privacy by Default:** No "opt-out" privacy â€“ user *opts-in* to data sharing.

> **"If you have to choose between security and convenience, choose security. Convenience can be added later; security cannot be retrofitted."**  
> â€” AegisOS Core Principle
